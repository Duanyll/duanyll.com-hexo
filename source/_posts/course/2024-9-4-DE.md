## Initial Value Problems

Problem formulation:

$$
\begin{cases}
    y'(t) = f(t, y(t)), & 0 < t, \\
    y(0) = a.
\end{cases}
$$

### Numerical Differentiation Based Methods

1. Grids
   $$
   t_j=jk,\quad j=0,1,\cdots M.
   $$
   $$
   k=\frac{T}{M}.
   $$
2. Evaluate the differential equation at the grid points
   $$
   y'(t_j)=f(t_j,y(t_j)).
   $$
3. Replace the derivative by a difference quotient
   $$
   y'(t_j)=\frac{y(t_{j+1})-y(t_j)}{k}+\tau_j,
   $$
   where $\tau_j$ is the truncation error. The equation becomes
   $$
   y(t_{j+1})-y(t_j)+k\tau_j=kf(t_j,y(t_j)).\
   $$
4. Drop the truncation error term
   $$
   y_{j+1}-y_j=kf(t_j,y_j).
   $$
   And the initial condition gives
   $$
   y_0=a.
   $$
5. Error analysis of $\tau$.
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
        y(t_{j+1})-y(t_j)+k\tau_j&=kf(t_j,y(t_j))\\
        kf(t_j,y(t_j))+\frac{f'(t_j)}{2}k^2+\cdots+k\tau_j&=kf(t_j,y(t_j))\\
        \tau_j&=\frac{f'(t_j)}{2}k+\cdots\sim O(k).
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   The method is first order accurate.

### Stability

Use the model problem

$$
y'(t)=-ry(t),\quad y(0)=\alpha.
$$

- A-stable: $j\to\infty$, is $y_j$ bounded?
- L-stable: For all $j$, $k\to\infty$, is $y_j$ bounded?
- Zero-stable: Let $r=0$, $j\to\infty$, is $y_j$ bounded?

### Numerical Integration Based Methods

![Numerical Intergration Formulas](https://cdn.duanyll.com/img/20240904164112.png)

1. Grids
   $$
   t_j=jk,\quad j=0,1,\cdots M.
   $$
   $$
   k=\frac{T}{M}.
   $$
2. Integrate the differential equation over the interval $[t_j,t_{j+1}]$
   $$
   \int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}}y'(t)\d t=\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}}f(t,y(t))\d t.
   $$
   That is
   $$
   y(t_{j+1})-y(t_j)=\int_{t_j}^{t_{j+1}}f(t,y(t))\d t.
   $$
3. Replace the integral by a quadrature formula
   $$
   y(t_{j+1})-y(t_j)=\frac{k}{2}(f(t_j,y(t_j))+f(t_{j+1},y(t_{j+1})))+O(k^3).
   $$
4. Drop the error term
   $$
    y_{j+1}=y_j+\frac{k}{2}(f_{j}+f_{j+1}).
   $$

Other notes:

- The idea of Runge-Kutta methods is to replace future $y_{j+1}$ values in implicit methods by values predicted by an explicit method.
- Extension and ghost points are used to handle boundary conditions, by adding extra points to the grid.
- Conservative methods are used to preserve the total energy of the system.

## Two-Point Boundary Value Problems

Problem formulation:

$$
\frac{\d^2 y}{\d x^2}+p(x)\frac{\d y}{\d x}+q(x)y=f(x),\quad y(0)=\alpha,\ y(\ell)=\beta.
$$

Using the five-step finite difference method, we will eventually get a system of linear equations to solve. Constant boundary conditions will give a tridiagonal system:

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{z},
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
    a_1 & c_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
    b_2 & a_2 & c_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
    0 & b_3 & a_3 & \cdots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & b_{N} & a_{N}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The tridiagonal matrix can be solved in $8N-7$ operations. To discuss the existence and uniqueness of the solution, we have these theorems:

- Theorem 1: $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible when either
  - $\mathbf{A}$ is strictly diagonally dominant, or
  - $\mathbf{A}$ is duagonally dominant, and $\forall i, c_i\neq 0$, $|b_N| < |a_N|$.
- Theroem 2: If $p(x), q(x), f(x)$ are continuous on $[0,\ell]$, then the solution of the BVP exists and is unique when the step size $h$ satisfies
  $$
  h<\frac{2}{\max_x|p(x)|}.
  $$
- Theorem 3 (Error Analysis): When the conditions of Theorem 2 are satisfied, the error of the finite difference method is
  $$
  |y(x_j)-y_j|\leq C|\tau_\infty+\max\{|E_0|,|E_{N+1}|\},
  $$
  where $C$ is a constant ($q(x)\leq -\gamma<0$, $C=\max\{1,1/\gamma\}$), $\tau_\infty$ is the truncation error, and $E_0, E_{N+1}$ are the boundary errors.

## Diffusion Problems

Problem formulation: The inhomogeneous heat equation

$$
\frac{\p^2 u}{\p x^2}=\frac{\p u}{\p t}+f(x,t),
$$

with initial condition $u(x,0)=g(x)$ and boundary conditions $u(0,t)=0$ and $u(1,t)=0$.

5-step explicit finite difference method will result in a matrix form of

$$
\mathbf{u}_{j+1}=\mathbf{Au}_j-k\mathbf{f}_j,
$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. FDE form:

$$
u_{i,j+1}=\lambda u_{i-1,j}+(1-2\lambda)u_{i,j}+\lambda u_{i+1,j}-k f_{i,j},
$$

where $\lambda=k/h^2$. To analyze the stability, sbustitute $u_{i,j}$ with

$$
u_{i,j}=w_je^{rx_iI},
$$

and deduce $\kappa=w_{j+1}/w_j$ from the FDE form. The method is stable if $|\kappa|\leq 1$ (regardless of $r$).

![Useful identities for stability analysis](https://cdn.duanyll.com/img/20240904230607.png)

- A-Stability: The method is A-stable if $|\kappa|\leq 1$ for all $r$.
- L-Stability: The method is L-stable if $|\kappa|\leq 1$ as $\lambda\to\infty$.

## Advection Problems

Problem formulation: The advection equation

$$
\frac{\p u}{\p t}+a\frac{\p u}{\p x}=0,
$$

with initial condition $u(x,0)=g(x)$ and periodic boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(1,t)$.

CFL condition: The numerical domain of dependence must contain the physical domain of dependence.

## Numerical Wave Propagation

Problem formulation: The wave equation

$$
c^2\frac{\p^2 u}{\p x^2}=\frac{\p^2 u}{\p t^2},
$$

with zero boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$ and initial conditions $u(x,0)=gfx)$ and $\frac{\p u}{\p t}(x,0)=g(x)$.

Solution properties: Substitute the plane wave solution

$$
u(x, t)=e^{I(kx-\omega t)}
$$

into the wave equation, and extract the coefficients of $e^{I(kx-\omega t)}$ to get the dispersion relation. Transform the dispersion relation to obtain the phase velocity,

$$
v_{ph}=\frac{\re\omega}{k}
$$

and the group velocity,

$$
v_{gr}=\frac{\p\omega}{\p k}.
$$

- Dispersive: $v_{ph}$ depends on $k$.
- Dissipative: $\im\omega\neq 0$.

## Elliptic Problems

Problem formulation: The Laplace equation

$$
\frac{\p^2 u}{\p x^2}+\frac{\p^2 u}{\p y^2}=0,
$$

with given boundary conditions.

Key points:

- Banded matrices can be used to solve the Laplace equation.
- Positive definite matrices (Geršgorin circle theorem)
- Iterative methods
